# BlockOpt.jl

This application supplements _QN Optimization with Hessian Samples_, an article currently under review. It's purpose is to explore block Quasi-Newton (QN) updates used in the unconstrained minimization of a smooth objective function.

## Documentation Structure

- The `Overview` section is concerned with the sofware design pattern used.
- The `Manual` section holds documentation for the `BlockOpt` _application programable interface_.
- The `Tutorial` sections provides typical use cases of `BlockOpt.jl`.
